Introduction
_________________

An unexpected unwanted event that disturbs the normal flow of the program is called exception.

e.g TierPumpturedException, SleepingException, FileNotFoundException, etc.

It is highly recommended to handle exceptions, and the main objective of exception handling is graceful termination of the program.


Exception handling doesn't mean repairing an exception we have to provide alternative way to continue rest of the program normally is the concept of exception handling.

e.g our programming requirement is to read data from remote file locating at London at runtime if London file is not available our program should not be terminated abnormally we have to provide some local file to continue rest of the program normally. This way of defining alternative is nothing but exception handling.

e.g

try{
	read data from remote file locating at London
} catch(FileNotFoundException e){
	use local file and continue rest of the program normally.
}
_________________________
RuneTimeStack mechanism
_________________________

For every thread JVM will create a runtime stack each and every method class performed by that thread will be stored in the corresponding stack each entry in the stack is called stack frame or activation record after completing every method call the corresponding entry from the stack will be removed. After completing all method calls the stack will become empty and that empty stack will be destroyed by JVM just before terminating the thread. 

class Test{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		doStuff();
	}

	public static void doStuff(){
		domoreStuff();
	}

	public static void domoreStuff(){
		sopln("Hello");
	}

}


an Empty runtime stack will be created for main thread.

________________________________________
Default Exception handling in java
________________________________________

inside a method if any exception occurred the method in which it is raised is responsible to create exception object by including the following information 

1. Name of Exception 
2. Description of exception
3. Location of at which exception occurs. (stack trace)

2. After creating exception method handover that object to the JVM 
3. JVM will check whether the method contains any exception handling code or not if the method doesn't contain exception handling code then     
   JVM terminates that method abnormally and removes the corresponding entry from the stack then JVM identifies identifier and checks whether caller method contain any handling code or not if the caller method doesn't contain handling code then JVM terminates the caller method also abnormally and removes corresponding entry from stack.
4. This process will be continued until main method and if the main() method also doesn't contain handling code then JVM terminates main() method also abnormally and removes corresponding entry from stack.

5. Then JVM handover responsibility of exception handling to default exception handler, which is the part of JVM. Default exception handler prints exception information in the following format and terminates program abnormally.

Format :

Exception in thread "XXX" name of the Exception : Description stackStrace.

class Test{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		doStuff();
	}
	public static void doStuff(){
		doMoreStuff();
	}
	public static void doMoreStuff(){
		sopln(10/0);
	}
}

Exception in therad "main" java.lang.ArithmaticException Division by zero 
at Test.doMoreStuff
at Test.doStuff
at Test.Main

e.g 2.

class Test{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		doStuff();
		sopln(10/0);
	}
	public static void doStuff(){
		doMoreStuff();
		sopln("Hi");
	}
	public static void doMoreStuff(){
		sopln("Hello");
	}
}

output:

Hello
Hi

Exception in therad "main" java.lang.ArithmaticException: / by zero 
at Test.Main

Note : In a program if at-list one method terminates abnormally then the program termination is abnormal termination if all methods terminated normally then only program termination is normal termination.
______________________
Exception hierarchy
______________________ 

Throwable class acts as root for java exception hierarchy.
Throwable class defines two child classes 
1. Exception
2. Error

Exception
___________

Most of the times exceptions are caused by our program and these are recoverable.

e.g if our programming requirement is to read data from remote file locating at London at runtime if remote file is not available then we will get runtime exception saying FileNotFoundException.

if FileNotFoundException occurs we can provide local file and continue rest of the program normally.

try{
	read data from remote file
	locating at London
}catch(FileNotFoundException e){
	use local file and continue 
	rest of the program normally.
}

________
Error
________

Most of the times errors are not caused by our program and these are due to lack of system resources Errors are non recoverable 

e.g if OutOfMemoryError occurs being a programmer we can't do any thing and the program will be terminated abnormally. System admin or server admin is responsible to increase heap memory.

___________________________________________
Checked Exceptions vs unchecked Exceptions
___________________________________________

1. Exceptions which are checked by compiler for smooth execution of the program are called checked exceptions 

e.g HallTicketMissingException 
    PenNotWorkingException
    FileNotFoundException etc.

2. In our program if there is a chance of rising checked exception then compulsory we should handle that checked exception(either by try catch or by throws keyword.) otherwise we will get compile time error.

3. The exceptions which are not checked by compiler whether programmer handling or not such type of exceptions are called unchecked exceptions.

e.g ArithmaticException, BomBlastException etc.

Note : 
________

1. Whether it is checked or unchecked every exception occurs at run-time only there is no chance of occurring any exception at compile time.
2. RuntimeException and its child classes, error and its child classes are unchecked. except these remaining are checked.
3. FullyChecked vs Partially Checked.
4. A checked exception is said to be fully checked if and only if all its child classes also checked e.g IOException, InterruptedException, 

   A checked exception is said to be partially checked if and only if some of its child classes are unchecked.
   
   e.g Exception, Throwable
   
Note : 
_______

1. The only possible partially checked exceptions in java are 
   1. Exception
   2. Throwable
   
Describe the behavior of following exceptions 	

1. IOException		---->Fully Checked
2. RuntimeException	---->UnChecked
3. InterruptedException ---->Fully Checked
4. Error		---->UnChecked
5. Throwable		---->Checked (partially checked)
6. ArithmaticException  ---->Unchecked
7. NullPointerException ---->UnChecked
8. Exception		---->Checked(partially checked)
9. FileNotFoundExceptoin---->Fully Checked
   
   
It is highly recommended to handle exception. The code which may rise an exception is called risky code and we have to define that code inside try block and corresponding handling code inside catch block.

try{

}catch(Exception e){
	handling code.
}

class Test{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		sopln("Hello");
		
		sopln(10/0);
		
		sopln("Hi");
	}
}

output:

Hello

RE : AE / by zero.

class Test{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		sopln("Hello");
		try{		
			sopln(10/0);
		}catch(Exception e){
			sopln(10/2);
		}
		sopln("Hi");
	}
}

output:

Hello

5

Hi

___________________________
Control-Flow in try-catch
___________________________

try{
	stmt1
	stmt2
	stmt3
}catch(){
	stmt4
}
stmt5

Case 1 : if there is no exception at 1,2,3,5 normal termination
Case 2 : if an exception raised at stmt 2 and corresponding catch block matched  then 1, 4, 5 normal termination.
Case 3 : if an exception raised at stmt 2 and corresponding catch block not matched 1, Abnormal termination.
Case 4 : if an exception raised at stmt 4 or stmt 5 then it is always abnormal termination.

Note : Within the try block if anywhere exception rised then rest of the try block won't be executed even though we handled that exception hence within the try block we have to take only risky code and length of try block should be as less as possible. In addition to try block there may be a chance of rising the exception inside catch and finally blocks.

if any statement which is not part of try block and rises an exception then it is always abnormal termination.

methods to print exception information.
________________________________________

Throwable class defines the following methods to print exception information 

method				printable format
______________________________________________________

1. printStackTract()	:	Name of exception : Description StackTrace.

2. toString()		:	Name of Exception : Description

3. getMessage()		:	Description.

  
class Test{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		try{
			sopln(10/0);
		}catch(Exception e){
			e.printStackTrace();---------> java.lang.ArithmaticException : / by zero at Test main(); 
			sopln(e.toString());---------> java.lang.ArithmaticException : / by zero;
			sopln(e.getMessage);---------> / by zero ;
		}
	}
} 

internally default exception handler will use printStackTract() method to print exception information to the console.

______________________________________
try with multiple catch block
______________________________________

the way of handling an exception is varied from exception to exception hence for every exception type it is highly recommended to take separate catch block i.e try with multiple catch block is always possible and recommended to use.

try{

}catch(Exception e){
	e.printStackTract();
}

worst programming practice.

try{

}catch(ArithmaticException e){
	perform alternative arithmetic operation
}catch(SQLException e){
	use mysql db instead of oracle db
}catch(FileNotFoundException e){
	use local file instead of remote file
}catch(Exception e){
	default exception handling
}

Good programming practice recommended to use

if try with multiple catch blocks present then the order of catch blocks is very important we have to take child first and then parent otherwise we will get compile time error saying

Exception : XXX has already been caught.
________________________________________

try{
	risky code
}catch(Exception e){
	default exception handling
}catch(ArithmaticException e){
	perform alternative arithmetic operation
}

CE: Exception : java.lang.ArithmaticException has already been caught.


try{
	risky code
}catch(ArithmaticException e){
	perform alternative arithmetic operation
}catch(Exception e){
	default exception handling
}

Compiles fine.

we can't declare two catch blocks for the same exception otherwise we will get compile time error.

try{
	risky code
}catch(ArithmaticException e){
	perform alternative arithmetic operation
}catch(ArithmaticException e){
	perform alternative arithmetic operation
}

CE: Exception : java.lang.ArithmaticException has already been caught.

________
final
________

1. final is modifier applicable for classes, methods and variables if a class declared as final then we can't extend that class i.e we can't create child class for that class i.e inheritance is not possible for final classes.

2. if a method is final then we can't override that method in the child class.

3. if a variable is declared as final then we can't perform reassignment for that variable.

__________
finally
__________

finally is a block always associated with try-catch to maintain cleanup code

try{
	risky code
}catch(Exception e){
	handling code
}finally{
	cleanup code.
}

the specialty of finally block is it will be executed always irrespective of whether exception is raised or not raised and whether handled or not handled.

_______________
finallize()
_______________

finalize is a method always invoked by garbage collector just before destroying an object to perform cleanup activities once finalize method completes immediately garbage collector destroys that object.

__________
Note : 
__________

finally block is responsible to perform cleanup activities related to try block i.e whatever resources we opened as a part of try block will be closed inside finally block. 

where as finalize method is responsible to perform cleanup activities related to object i.e whatever resources associated with object will be deallocated before destroying an object by using finalize method. 

________________________________________________________
various possible combinations of try-catch-finally.
________________________________________________________

1. in try-catch-finally order is important 

2. whenever we are writing try compulsory we should write either catch or finally otherwise we will get compile time error i.e try without catch or finally is invalid.

3. whenever we are writing catch block compulsory try must be required i.e catch without try is invalid

4. whenever we are writing finally block compulsory we should write try block i.e finally without try is invalid.

5. inside try catch and finally blocks we can declare try-catch-finally blocks i.e nesting of try-catch-finally is allowed.

6. for try-catch-finally blocks curly braces are mandatory.

_______________
Throw keyword
_______________

Programmer throws Exception object and JVM will catch Exception object 

Some times we can create exception object explicitly we can handover to the JVM manually for this we have to use throw keyword

throw new ArithmaticException : / by zero.--------------->Creation of ArithmeticException object explicitly
   |
  \|/
Handover our created exception object to the JVM manually.

Hence the main objective of throw keyword is to handover our created exception object to the JVM manually hence the result of following two programs is exactly same.

class Test{							class Test{
	public static void main(String[] args){				public static void main(String[] args){
		sopln(10/0);							throw new ArithmaticException("/ by zero");			
	}								}
}								}


Exception in thread main() java.lang.ArithmaticException:/ by	Exception in thread main() java.lang.ArithmaticException / by
zero at Test.main();						zero at Test.main();


in this case main method is responsible to create		In this case programmer is creating exception object explicitly.
exception object and handover to the JVM.			and handover to the JVM manually.

Note : Best use of throw keyword is for user defined exceptions or customized exceptions.

Case 1 : throw e;

if e refers null then we will get NullPointerException.

class Test{									class Test{
	static ArithmaticException e = new ArithmaticException();			static ArithmaticException e;
	public static void main(String[] args){						public static void main(String[] args){
		throw e;									throw e;
	}										}
}										}

RE : AE										RE : NPE


Case 2 : After throw statement we are not allowed to write any statement directly otherwise we will get compile time error saying unreachable
															          -----------	
	 statement
	 ----------

class Test{								class Test{
	public static void main(String[] args){					public static void main(String[] args){
		sopln(10/0);								throw e;
		sopln("Hello");								sopln("Hello");
	}									}
}									}

RE : AE									CE : Unreachable statement.

Case 3 : we can use throw keyword only for Throwable types if we are trying to use for normal java objects we will get compile time error saying incomputable types.

class Test{								class Test throws RuntimeException{
	public static void main(String[] args){						public static void main(String[] args){
		throw new Test();								throw new Test();
	}										}
}									}

CE : incompatible types							CE : Exeception in thread "main" Test at Test.main()
found : Test
Required : java.lang.Throwable


Throws keyword

in our program if there is possibility of rising checked exception then compulsory we should handle that checked exception otherwise we will get compile time error saying 

Unreported exception XXX must be caught or declared to be thrown.

E.g 

import java.io.*;

class Test{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter("abc.txt");
		
		pw.println("Hello");
	}
}

CE : unreported Exception java.io.FileNotFoundException 
must be caught or declared to be thrown.

e.g 2.

class Test{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		
		Thread.sleep(10000);
	}
}

CE : unreported exception java.lang.InterrupedException must be caught or declared to be thrown.

we can handle this compile time error by using the following two ways

1. by using try-catch.

class Test{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		try{		
			Thread.sleep(10000);
		}catch(InterruptedException e){
			
		}
	}
}

2. By using throws keyword.

we can use throws keyword to deli-get responsibility of exception handling to the caller(it may be another method or JVM) then caller method is responsible to handle that exception.

e.g 

class Test{
	public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
		
		Thread.sleep(10000);
	}
}

throws keyword required only for checked exceptions, usage of throws keyword for unchecked exceptions there is no use or there is no impact.

throws keyword required only to convince compiler and usage of throws keyword doesn't prevent abnormal termination of the program.

class Test{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		
		doStuff();
	}
	public static void doStuff(){-------------------------->CE : unreported exception j.l.IE
		doMoreStuff();					     must be caught or declared to 	
	}							     be thrown.
	public static void doMoreStuff() throws IE{
		Thread.sleep(10000);
	}
}

class Test{
	public static void main(String[] args) throws IE{
		
		doStuff();
	}
	public static void doStuff() throws IE{
		doMoreStuff();			
	}					
	public static void doMoreStuff() throws IE{
		Thread.sleep(10000);
	}
}
valid


in the above program if we remove at-list one throws statement then the code won't compile



		      |	we can delegate responsibility of exception of handling to the caller it may be a method or JVM
		      |
throws class----------|	these required only for checked exception and usage of throws keyword for unchecked exceptions there is no impact.
		      |
		      | it is required only to compiler and usage of throws keyword doesn't prevent abnormal termination of the program.


it is recommended to use try-catch over throws keyword

Case 1. 
	we can use throws keyword for methods and constructors but not for classes.
	
class Test throws Exception{			------------------->invalid

	Test() throws Exception{		------------------->valid
	
	}
	public static void m1() throws Exception{------------------->valid
		
	}
}

we can use throws keyword only for Throwable types if we are trying to use for normal java classes then we will get compile time error saying incompatible types.

e.g 

class Test{
	public void m1() throws Test{---------> CE : incompatible type found : Test required : Throwable
		
	}
}


class Test extends RuntimeException{
	public void m1() throws Test{
		
	}
}

Case 3. 

class Test{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		throw new Exception();		//CE---------->unreported exception java.lang.Exception must be caught or declared to be thrown.
	}
}

class Test{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		throw new Error();		//CE---------->Exception in Test "main" java.lang.Error at Test.main().
	}
}

within the try block if there is no chance of rising an exception then we can't write catch block for that exception otherwise we will get compile time error saying Exception XXX is never thrown in body of corresponding try statement but this rule is applicable only for fully checked exceptions.


class Test{			class Test{			class Test{			class Test{			

	p.s.v.main(String[] s){		p.s.v.main(String[] s){		p.s.v.main(String[] s){		p.s.v.String(main[] args){		
		try{				try{				try{				try{
		     sopln("Hello");		   sopln("Hello");		   sopln("Hello");		   sopln("Hello");
			}catch(AE e){		}catch(Exception e){		}catch(IOException e){		}catch(InterruptedException e){
				
		}				}				}				}
	}				}				}				}
}				}				}				}

____________________________________________
Customized or user defined exceptions
____________________________________________

Some times to meet programming requirements we can define our own exceptions such type of exceptions are called customized or user defined exceptions 

e.g TooYoungException
TooOldException
InsufficientFundsException
etc.

class TooYoungException extends RuntimeException{
	TooYoungException(String s){
		super(s);-----------------------------> To make description available to default exception handler.
	}
}

class TooOldException extends RuntimeException{
	TooOldException(String s){
		super(s);
	}
}

class CustException{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		int age = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
		
		if(age > 60){
			Throws new TooYoungException("Plz wait some more time you will get best match soon");
		}else if(age < 18){
			Throws new TooOldException("Your age is already crossed marriage age you can't get marriage  ");
		}else{
			sopln("you will get match details soon by email");
		}
	}
}

Note : 1. throw keyword is best suitable for user defined or customized exceptions but not for pre-defined exceptions.
2. It is highly recommended to define customized exceptions as unchecked i.e we have to extends RuntimeException class but not Exception.

____________________________
Top 10 Exceptions
____________________________

Based on the person who is rising an exception all exceptions are divided into two categories.

1. JVM Exceptions 
2. Programatic Exceptions.

JVM Exceptions
______________

The exceptions which are raised automatically by JVM whenever a particular event occurs are called JVM Exceptions.

e.g. ArithmaticException, NullPointerException etc.

2. Programmatic Exceptions : the exceptions which are raised explicitly either by programmer or by API developer to indicate that some thing goes wrong are called programmatic exceptions.
e.g TooOldException, TooYoungException, InsuffucientFundException etc.

1. ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

It is child class of RunTimeException and hence it is unchecked.
Raised automatically by JVM whenever we are trying to access array element with out-of-range index.

e.g

int[] x = new int[4];

sopln(x[0]);	//0
sopln(x[10]);	// RE : ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
sopln(x[-10]);	// RE : ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

2. NullPointerException

It is child class of RunTimeException and hence it is unchecked.
Raised automatically by JVM whenever we are trying to perform any operation on null.

String s = null;

sopln(s.length());	//RE : NullPointerException

3. ClassCastException

It is child class of RunTimeException and hence it is unchecked.
Raised automatically by JVM whenever we are trying to typecast parent object to child type.

String s = new String("Test");

Object o = (Object) s;	//valid

Object o = new Object();
String s = (String) o;	//Invalid RE : ClassCastException

Object o = new String("Test");//valid
String s = (String) o;	//valid

4. StackOverFlowError

It is child class of Error and hence it is unchecked.
Raised automatically by JVM whenever we are trying to perform recursive method call.

e.g 
class Test{
	public static void m1(){
		m2();
	}
	
	public static void m2(){
		m1();
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args){
		m1();				// RE : StackOverFlowError
	}
}

5. NoClassDefFoundError:

It is child class of Error and hence it is unchecked.
Raised automatically by JVM whenever JVM unable to find required .class file.

e.g 

java Test

if Test.class file is not available then we will get RunTimeException saying NoClassDefinationFoundError:Test

6. ExceptionInInitializerError:

It is child class of Error and hence it is unchecked.
Raised automatically by JVM whenever if any exception occurs while executing static variable assignments and static blocks.


e.g 1

class Test{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		int x = 10/0;			// RE : ExceptionInInitializerError caused by / by zero
	}
}

class Test{
	static{
		String s = null;
		sopln(s.length());		//RE : ExceptionInInitializerError caused by NullPointerException
	}
}

7. IllegalArgumentException : 

It is child class of Exception and hence it is unchecked.
Raised automatically by JVM whenever if any exception occurs while executing static variable assignments and static blocks.

It is the child class of runtime exception and hence it is unchecked.
Raised explicitly either by programmer or by API Developer to indicate that a method has been invoked with illegalArgument.

e.g 

The valid range of thread priotaries is 1 to 10 if we are trying to set the priority with any other value then we will get RunTimeException Saying illegalArgumentException 

e.g Thread t = new Thread();

t.setPriority(7);

t.setPriority(15); IllegalArgumentException

8. NumberFormatException

It is the direct child class of IllegalArgumentException which is child class of RunTimeException and hence it is unchecked.
Raised explicitly either by programmer or by API developer to indicate that we are trying to convert String to Number and the String is not properly formated 

e.g int i = Integer.parseInt(10);
int i = Integer.parseInt("ten");		//RE : NumberFormatException.

9. IllegalStateException

It is child class of RuntimeException and hence it is unchecked raised explicitly either by programmer or by API developer to indicate that a method has been invoked at wrong time.

e.g After starting of a thread we are not allowed to restart same thread once again otherwise we will get RuntimeException saying IllegalThreadStateException.

Thread t = new Thread();

t.start();	//valid

t.start();	// RE : IllegalThreadStateException

10. AssertionError

It is the child class of error and hence it is unchecked

raised explicitly by the programmer or by API developer to indicate that AssertStatement fails.

e.g assert(x > 10);

if x is not greater than 10 then we will get RuntimeException saying assertion error.

______________________________________________________________
1.7 version enhancements with respect to exception handling. 
______________________________________________________________

As the part of 1.7 version in exception handling the following two concepts introduced.

1. try with resources
2. multi-catch block

_________________________
1. try with resources
_________________________

Until 1.6 version it is highly recommended to write finally block to close resources which are opened as a part of try block.

BufferedReader br = null;

try{
	br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("Input.txt"));
	
	//use br based on our requirement
}catch(IOException e){
	//handling code
}finally{
	if(br != null){
		br.close();
	}
}

The problems in above approach are compulsory programmer required to close resources inside finally block

1. it increase complexity of programming 
2. we have to write finally block compulsory and hence it increase length of the code and reduces readability.
3. To overcome above problems sun people introduced try-with resources in 1.7 version.

the main advantage of try with resources is whatever resources we open as a part of try block will be closed automatically once control reaches end of try block either normally or abnormally and hence we are not required to close explicitly so that complexity of programming will be reduced. we are not required to write finally block so that length of the code will be reduced and readability will be improved.

try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("Input.txt"))){
	//use br based on our requirement
	//br will be closed automatically once control reaches end of try block either normally or abnormally.
}catch(IOException e){
	handling code
}

we can declare multiple resources but these resources should be separated with semicolon (';') 

e.g try(FileWriter fw = new FileWriter("output.txt"); FileReader fr = new FileReader("Input.txt")){
		
}

All resources should be auto-closable resources

A resource is said to be auto-closable if and only if corresponding class implements java.lang.AutoClosable interface all io related resources database related resources and network related resources are already implemented auto-closable inerface. Being a programmer we are not required to do any thing just we should aware the point.

Auto-closable interface came in 1.7 version and it contains only one method 

public void close();

All resource reference variables are implicitly final and hence within the try block we can't perform re-assignment otherwise we will get compile time error.

class TryWithResources{
	public static void main(String[] args){
	
		try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("input.txt"))){
			br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("output.txt"));			// CE : Autoclosable resource br may not be 
		}										// assigned 
	}
}

until 1.6 version try should be associated with either catch or finally but from 1.7 version we can take only try with resource without catch or finally.

e.g 

try(Resource){

}

completely valid syntax from 1.7

The main advantage of try with resources is we are not required to write finally block explicitly because we are not required to close resources explicitly. Hence until 1.6 version finally block is just like Hero but in 1.7 version finally block is dummy and becomes zero.

_____________________
Multi-catch block
_____________________

Until 1.6 version even though multiple different exceptions having same handling code for every exception type we have to write a separate catch block it increase length of the code and reduces readability 

try{

}catch(ArithmaticException e){
	e.printStackTrace();
	
}catch(IOException e){
	e.printStackTrace();
	
}catch(NullPointerException e){
	e.printStackTrace();
	
}catch(InterruptedException e){
	
	e.printStackTrace();
}

to overcome this problem sun people introduced multi catch block in 1.7 version.
According to this we can write a single catch block that can handle multiple different type of exceptions.

try{

}catch(ArithmaticException|IOException e){
	e.printStackTrace();
}catch(NullPointerException | InterruptedException e){
	sopln(e.getMessage());
}

the main advantage of this approach is length of the code will be reduced and readability will be improved.

class MultiCatchBlock{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		try{
			System.out.println(10/0);
			String s = null;
			System.out.println(s.length());
		}catch(ArithmaticException | NullPointerException e){
			System.out.println(e);
		}
	}
}

in the above example whether raised exception is either ArithmaticException or NullPointerException the same catch block lesone 

in multi-catch block there should not be any relation between exception types (either child to parent or parent to child or same type) otherwise we will get compile time error.

try{

}catch(ArithmaticException | Exception e){
	e.printStackTrace();			// CE : Alternatives in a multi-catch statement cannot be related by subclassing	
}

_________________________
Exception propagation
_________________________

Inside a method if an exception raised and if we are not handling that exception then exception object will be propagated to caller then caller method is responsible to handle exception this process is called exception propagation.

______________________
Re-throwing exception
______________________

we can use this approach to convert one exception type to another exception type

e.g try{
	sopln(10/0);
}catch(ArithmaticException e){
	throw new NullPointerException();
}
